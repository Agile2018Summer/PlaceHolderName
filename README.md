## [Product Backlog](https://github.com/Agile2018Summer/Trello-Slack-Integration/projects/1)

-----

## Backlog order reasoning

The project backlog is ordered in such a way that it should minimize the additional work needed when addressing the PBIs that have a lower priority.


## Definition of Ready

1) We have a self-explanatory title for every Item in the backlog.
2) We have clear user stories .
3) We have a good metric of estimating each story
3) We are aware of what tools are necessary to develope the item.
4) The team agrees  on a common definition of done.
5) We  have an optimally organized backlog.

#### Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity: Planning Poker

-----
Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates for the Product Backlock Items, as all members of the Scrum Team are part of the Development Team.
