## [Product Backlog](https://github.com/Agile2018Summer/Trello-Slack-Integration/projects/1)

-----

## Backlog order reasoning

The project backlog is ordered in such a way that it should minimize the additional work needed when addressing the PBIs that have a lower priority.


## Definition of Ready

1) We have a self-explanatory title for every Item in the backlog.
2) We have clear user stories .
3) We have a good metric of estimating each story
3) We are aware of what tools are necessary to develope the item.
4) The team agrees  on a common definition of done.
5) We  have an optimally organized backlog.

#### Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity: Planning Poker

-----
Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates for the Product Backlock Items, as all members of the Scrum Team are part of the Development Team.



## Project part 2: first sprint:

#### Forecast of how many story points can be delivered within a sprint 
13.
#### Rational behind it 
We divided the total story points into 3 (3 sprint).
#### Sprint backlog
https://github.com/Agile2018Summer/Trello-Slack-Integration/projects/2 
#### One daily scrum report

#### Unit tests folder

## Retrospective
What went wrong
1- Team meetings timing were not well ogenised,
2- Testing integrated code was challenges
3- Underestimating the project

What went right
1- Daily scrum conducte
2- Research is done
3- Backlog is updated
4- Linking tasks with stories in the backlog

Who to improve:
1- Agree on fixed times for team meeting
2- Make a more realistic estimation

## Project part 3: Second Sprint:

#### Forecast of how many story points can be delivered within a sprint 
11.
#### Rational behind it 
According to the process in last sprint.

#### Unit tests folder
https://github.com/Agile2018Summer/Trello-Slack-Integration/tree/master/src/test/java/edu/harvard/integration

#### Retrospective
What went wrong
1. Too few mob programming actions.
2. Unit test highly dependent on internet connection.
3. Time table for all members not synchronized well.
4. When developing, often forget to symmetrically update on backlogs.

What went right
1. Daily scrum conducte
2. Finish some of PBIs.

Who to improve:
1. Ensure that there is one daily scrum every day.
2. Pay more attention on backlogs rather than just coding.

#### Forecast of how many story points can be delivered within a sprint 
9.

#### Rational behind it
